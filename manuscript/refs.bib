We assembled the largest global dataset to date on emission rates of all three GHGs and found they covary with lake size and trophic state. Fitted models were upscaled to estimate global emission using global lake size inventories and a remotely sensed global lake productivity distribution. Traditional upscaling approaches overestimated CO2 and N2O emission but underestimated CH4 by half. Our upscaled size-productivity weighted estimates (1.25\textendash{}2.30 Pg of CO2-equivalents annually) are nearly 20\% of global CO2 fossil fuel emission with  75\% of the climate impact due to CH4. Moderate global increases in eutrophication could translate to 5\textendash{}40\% increases in the GHG effects in the atmosphere, adding the equivalent effect of another 13\% of fossil fuel combustion or an effect equal to GHG emissions from current land use change.},

In this paper, we reassess the empirical evidence on the best-fitting distribution in relation to the truncation point issue. Specifically, we provide a comparison among four recently proposed approaches and alternative definitions of U.S. cities. Our results highlight the importance to look at issue of the best-fitting distribution together with the truncation issue and provide guidance with respect to the existing tests of the truncation point.},

Therefore, we compared WB abundance and size-distribution parameters (slope [b] and model fit [r2]) in 164 regions in the United States with varying topography, climate, and agricultural intensity. We found all three factors influenced WB size-distributions and their fit to expected models. WB size-distributions in steeper terrain had more small WB and better fit power-law models, while regions with flatter terrain and greater precipitation had poorer fits. Extensive agriculture increased the proportion of small WB, causing distributions in some regions to fall outside theoretically predicted limits (bCDF $<$ 21). Regional variation of WB sizedistributions can help develop and test integrated theory that accounts for geophysical and anthropogenic drivers of WB sizes, which is essential for scaling biogeochemical processes in aquatic systems.},

NARWidth contains measurements of $>$2.4 \texttimes{} 105 km of rivers wider than 30 m at mean annual discharge. We find that conventional digital elevation model-derived width data sets underestimate the abundance of wide rivers. To calculate the total surface area of North American rivers, we extrapolate the strong observed relationship between river width and total surface area at different river widths (r2 $>$ 0.99 for 100\textendash{}2000 m widths) to narrower rivers and streams. We conservatively estimate the total surface area of North American rivers as 1:24\th\`A00::3195 \texttimes{} 105 km2 (1$\sigma$ confidence intervals), values 20\th\`A3185\% greater than previous estimates used to evaluate greenhouse gas efflux from rivers to the atmosphere.},
