  abstract = {As hydraulic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical models evolve toward greater spatial resolution and larger extent, robust morphometric data sets are essential to constrain their results. Here we present the Landsat-derived North American River Width (NARWidth) data set, the first fine-resolution, continental scale river centerline and width database. NARWidth contains measurements of {$>$}2.4 \texttimes{} 105 km of rivers wider than 30 m at mean annual discharge. We find that conventional digital elevation model-derived width data sets underestimate the abundance of wide rivers. To calculate the total surface area of North American rivers, we extrapolate the strong observed relationship between river width and total surface area at different river widths (r2 {$>$} 0.99 for 100\textendash 2000 m widths) to narrower rivers and streams. We conservatively estimate the total surface area of North American rivers as 1:24\th\`A00::3195 \texttimes{} 105 km2 (1{$\sigma$} confidence intervals), values 20\th\`A3185\% greater than previous estimates used to evaluate greenhouse gas efflux from rivers to the atmosphere.},

Fitted models were upscaled to estimate global emission using global lake size inventories and a remotely sensed global lake productivity distribution. Traditional upscaling approaches overestimated CO2 and N2O emission but underestimated CH4 by half. Our upscaled size-productivity weighted estimates (1.25\textendash 2.30 Pg of CO2-equivalents annually) are nearly 20\% of global CO2 fossil fuel emission with   75\% of the climate impact due to CH4. Moderate global increases in eutrophication could translate to 5\textendash 40\% increases in the GHG effects in the atmosphere, adding the equivalent effect of another 13\% of fossil fuel combustion or an effect equal to GHG emissions from current land use change.},

However, the global extent of drawdown areas is unknown, precluding an accurate assessment of the carbon budget of reservoirs. Here we show, on the basis of satellite observations of 6,794 reservoirs between 1985 and 2015, that 15\% of the global reservoir area was dry. Exposure of drawdown areas was most pronounced in reservoirs close to the tropics and shows a complex dependence on climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic (water use) drivers. We re-assessed the global carbon emissions from reservoirs by apportioning CO               2               and methane emissions to water surfaces and drawdown areas using published areal emission rates. The new estimate assigns 26.2 (15\textendash 40) (95\% confidence interval) TgCO               2               -C yr               -1               to drawdown areas, and increases current global CO               2               emissions from reservoirs by 53\% (60.3 (43.2\textendash 79.5) TgCO               2               -C yr               -1               ). Taking into account drawdown areas, the ratio between carbon emissions and carbon burial in sediments is 2.02 (1.04\textendash 4.26). This suggests that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury, challenging the current understanding that reservoirs are net carbon sinks. Thus, consideration of drawdown areas overturns our conception of the role of reservoirs in the carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {The established approach to model seston size distributions involves the grouping of particles within logarithmic size classes and the examination of the relationship between density, or normalized biomass, and the characteristic sizes of the classes. Here we examine the distributional basis of the established approach and draw a connection between the biomass size spectrum and the Pareto distribution, a model widely used in other disciplines dealing with size-structured systems. We provide efficient estimators of the parameters and also suggest that datasets exhibiting significant departures from a smooth power function decline can be adequately modeled using a Pareto type II distribution.},
